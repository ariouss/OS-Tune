OS Tune
=========

Ansible roles to tune Operating Systems, focused on Debian 12. Roles are tested by [Molecule](https://ansible.readthedocs.io) and [molecule-libvirt](https://pypi.org/project/molecule-libvirt) and can be run manually, but we use [AWX](https://www.ansible.com/community/awx-project) for deployments.
